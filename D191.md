##### Official Course Description<sup>[1]</sup>
*Advanced Data Management enables organizations to extract and analyze raw data. Skillful data management allows organizations to discover and explore data in ways that uncover trends, issues, and their root causes. In turn, businesses are better equipped to capitalize on opportunities and more accurately plan for the future. As organizations continue to extract larger and more detailed volumes of data, the need is rapidly growing for IT professionals possessing data management skills. These skills include performing advanced relational data modeling as well as designing data marts, lakes, and warehouses. This course will empower software developers with the skills to build business logic at the database layer to employ more stability and higher data-processing speeds. Data analysts will gain the ability to automate common tasks to summarize and integrate data as they prepare it for analysis. Data Management is a prerequisite for this course.*

*This course covers the following competencies:*
- *Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized course plan together.*
- *The graduate writes complex SQL statements in order to implement functions, stored procedures, and triggers to prepare data sets for data analysis and manipulation.*
- *The graduate configures data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks in order to automate data integration*

<br />

##### Assessment Type: Exam
This course uses a project called an Performance Assessment. In order to complete the course, you need to submit a video recording running specified queries and supplementary paper, and prove competency in the following subjects:
- Writing Complex SQL Statements for 79% 
- Configuring Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) Workflows for 21%

## My Experiences with Class
When I began this course it was an exam-only, OA class. However, part way through my term it was changed into a PA-only course. Although this may change in later updates, I went straight to the PA page to determine how to proceed with the course. It took a couple of days to fully understand what the PA was asking me to do, but once I figured it out, it was fairly easy. Essentially you're just performing a few advanced SQL queries in a virtual lab enviroment (using PostgreSQL's Query Tool on an example database), answering some questions about it in a paper, and recording your queries being run in the lab. I later wrote out a full "walkthrough" of sorts to help other students understand the requirements how I did. I've included a backup version of that page in the repo for safekeeping.

The below posts refer to the old OA version of the course. I've kept them here since they provide some useful tips for Postgre and SQL in general.

### Learning Resources
Below is a list of learning resources that have helped myself and others who have taken this class out. The majority of these are free and those that aren't, such as some of the books, can be found online in their entirety.

For more resources specific to the PA project, please see the walkthrough listed above under "Great Write-Ups".

| Name | Type of Resource | Notes on Resource |
| ---- |  ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [D191 Advanced Data Management Textbook](https://my.wgu.edu/home) | Interactive Online Textbook | Currently the course does not have an interactive textbook. It used to have Ucertify but it has since been removed. This is just a placeholder link now. | 
| [GeeksforGeeks' SQL Tutorial ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-tutorial/) | Website | GeeksforGeeks also offers their own SQL tutorial in the middle of a larger section on Database Management Systems. It may cover more than this course requires, but it's definitely worth bookmarking for later. | 
| [GeeksforGeeks' Database Management System Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/) | Website | The larger section on Database Management Systems from GeeksforGeeks that the above comes from. Beyond SQL, understanding how databases work themselves is an important concept to learn. | 
| [PostgreSQL Website](https://www.postgresql.org/) | Website / Software | While you're at it, here's the PostgreSQL website so you can download it and read up on the documentation. | 
| [Freecodecamp's Learn PostgreSQL Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw--VYLpxG4) | Videos / Video Course | I believe in this course you move onto PostgreSQL, so here's a nice video tutorial on it. | 
| [PostgreSQL® Notes for Professionals book by GoalKicker.com](https://goalkicker.com/PostgreSQLBook/) | Textbook | Goalkicker's also got a handy little book on PostgreSQL to get you up to speed on it. Also, 100% free. |
