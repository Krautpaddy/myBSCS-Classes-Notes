# Krautpaddy's Book Recommendations

## Updates
I had to move the book recommendations to their own page, they were originally on the [Tips page.](TipsPage.md) I'm like super tired right now, so I'll finish this page sometime throughout the week. There's more recommendations than those I have listed right now, the process to write them up is just slow.

| <img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1447957962l/25744928._SY475_.jpg" width="135" /> |  **Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport** <br /> 296 pages <br/> If you're struggling to find distraction-free time to study, start with Deep Work. It introduces the concept of "Deep Work", a sort of zone that highly productive thinkers get into when creating their masterpieces. Anyone can get into this zone, but doing so requires you to eliminate distractions that can disrupt it. Deep Work contains a lot of great suggestions to do that, so I recommend starting with it. [See the book's page.](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549433350l/40672036._SY475_.jpg" width="135" /> | **Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport** <br /> 302 pages <br /> Digital Minimalism is also by the author of Deep Work and kinda serves as a bit of a supplement to it. Both books deal with our "distracted world" but this one offers advice on making technology less of a distraction for us. If you're having trouble staying away from your phone while studying, give this a read. [See the book's page.](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1535115320l/40121378._SY475_.jpg" width="135" /> |  **Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones by James Clear** <br /> 319 pages <br /> Although it may be 300+ pages, this is a quick read and a really inspirational book that reminds you the importance of working every day towards your goals. Remember, if every day you made a 1% improvement towards your goals, imagine what you would accomplish in a year. If you're having trouble hitting your "1% improvement" a day, I recommend giving this a read. [See the book's page.](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) | 
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409262236l/23121356.jpg" width="135" /> | **Your Brain On Porn: Internet Pornography and the Emerging Science of Addiction by Gary Wilson** <br /> 180 pages <br /> I know what you're thinking, *wait, I'm not a porn addict, why should I read a book about porn addiction?!* First of all, because our field, programmers and the like, have a high prevelance of porn addiction. And second, because addiction is addiction, whether it be to porn, social media, alcohol, whatever. Although this book is focused around abstaining from porn, there are lessons to be used in basically any addiction. [See the book's page.](https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/) | 
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1310993739l/567610.jpg" width="135" /> | **How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading by Mortimer J. Adler, Charles Van Doren** <br /> 426 pages <br /> A little bit of a longer read, How to Read a Book is a book about effectively reading. It's from the 40s and is still highly relevant and worthwhile to read today and will help you on your reading journey to getting the most out of the books you'll be studying. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575009552l/18693655._SY475_.jpg" width="135" /> | **A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra) by Barbara Oakley** <br /> 336 pages <br /> You may have heard of A Mind for Numbers from the popular Learning How to Learn Coursera course. It's the book that course is based on. While at first glance, it would seem that this book is really only for learning math and science, it's actually just a book on learning (although math concepts are used  as examples). There's a lot of good suggestions on studying and such that make it a great followup to Deep Work. [See the book's page.](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers/) |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349052024l/192221.jpg" width="135" /> | **How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method by George Pólya** <br /> 288 pages <br /> George Pólya's book is a classic and very applicable to what you'll be learning. It's also a great book on problem solving in general and I suspect, was an inspiration to the below title, The Art and Craft of Problem Solving. Even if you've already transfered in every math class possible for this degree, you should read this book. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348957736l/593458.jpg" width="135" /> | **The Art and Craft of Problem Solving by Paul Zeitz** <br /> 366 pages <br /> As you dig into programming and the foundational maths for computer science, you'll come to realize how valueable the ability to problem solve is. This book will teach you some strategies and tactics to help you get into the mindset necessary to effectively solve problems. You won't see any code in it, but you will see topics from Algebra, Calculus, and Discrete Mathematics. [See the book's page.](https://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=1119094844&bcsId=10662) |
| <img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390692774l/3063393.jpg" width="135" /> |  **Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware by Andy Hunt** <br /> 251 pages <br /> Pragmatic Thinking and Learning is sort of like A Mind for Numbers, but for Programmers. It goes into a bit of Neuroscience, the Dreyfus skill acquisition models, mind maping, etc. It's a nice short book from the Pragmatic Bookshelf that I think is worth giving a read. [See the book's page.](https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/) |

<br /> 

### Computer Science Basics

|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349077531l/6744151.jpg" width="135" /> | **College Algebra by Robert Blitzer** <br /> 848 pages <br /> If you've never taken College Algebra, Precalculus, or anything similar, I suggest using Blitzer's College Algebra (although his Precalculus book covers almost the same material). Blitzer makes some very "user-friendly" algebra and pre-calculus books. I used them for Algebra up to Precalculus and enjoyed them. [See the book's page.](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Blitzer-My-Lab-Math-with-Pearson-e-Text-for-College-Algebra-Access-Card-18-Weeks-8th-Edition/PGM100003053829.html?tab=resources) | 
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312067998l/818063.jpg" width="135" /> | **Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Phillips Thompson, Martin Gardner** <br /> 336 pages <br /> If you're taking Calculus at WGU, this book will help simplfy some of the more dizzying concepts of Derivatives and Integrals. You can also find the entire text for free right [here](https://calculusmadeeasy.org/)! |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387735275l/328645.jpg" width="135" /> | **Calculus by Michael Spivak** <br /> 670 pages <br /> When it comes to Calculus, everyone's got their favorite textbook. If you have a strong foundation in logic and proofs, you may find yourself a part of the Spivak devoted. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386748153l/282035.jpg" width="135" /> | **Calculus, Volume 1: One-Variable Calculus with an Introduction to Linear Algebra by Tom M. Apostol** <br /> 688 pages <br /> There are plenty of Calculus textbooks, so take your pick. Apostol's Calculus is interesting in that it actually covers Integration before Differentiation, which may be a bit confusing at first, but it's a rigourous book and worth trying if you're interesting in moving up to higher maths. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1554794043l/44921543._SY475_.jpg" width="135" /> | **How to Prove It: A Structured Approach by Daniel J. Velleman** <br /> 468 pages <br /> How to Prove It is a beginner friendly introduction to proofs and covers the foundations of Discrete Mathematics in a similar fashion to the Book of Proof. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371435462l/18060393.jpg" width="135" /> | **Book of Proof by Richard Hammack** <br /> 314 pages <br /> Once you've completed Calculus, it's time to step into the logic-based maths. Coming directly from computational maths to abstract ones can be a bit tricky, but Book of Proof is really great bridge. It covers logic, sets, counting, inductions, relations, etc. [See the book's page.](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/) | 
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386922315l/250872.jpg" width="135" /> | **A Mathematical Introduction to Logic by Herbert B. Enderton** <br /> 317 pages <br /> This ia nice introductory logic books to pair with Book of Proof for your Discrete Math classes. It focuses on logic as it relates to Computer Science, so you're likely to get more out of it than any other logic book. Definitely check out the author's other works. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348189124l/558206.jpg" width="135" /> | **Elements of Set Theory by Herbert B. Enderton** <br /> 279 pages <br /> Another math book by Herbert B. Enderton. This one focuses on Set Theory. It's short and an easy read, just make sure to do the exercises! |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1354904422l/558194.jpg" width="135" /> | **Naive Set Theory by Paul R. Halmos** <br /> 104 pages <br /> If Elements of Set Theory isn't short enough for you, this is an even shorter. I've seen it recommended a lot but haven't gotten my hands on it...yet! |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356140227l/15858021.jpg" width="135" /> | **Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics by Gary Chartrand, Albert D. Polimeni, Ping Zhang** <br /> 424 pages <br /> This textbook starts off with logic and set theory and builds up to proofs and applying them to topics from Calculus, Linear Algebra, and beyond. [See the book's page.](https://wps.pearsoned.com/aw_chartrand_mathproofs_3/) |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387720133l/12328423.jpg" width="135" /> | **Discrete Mathematics by Gary Chartrand, Ping Zhang** <br /> 671 pages <br /> If you would prefer to have an all-in-one book for Discrete Math, one of the Math CIs recommended this to me. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375771781l/12836498.jpg" width="135" /> | **Mathematics for Computer Science by Eric Lehman, F. Thomson Leighton, Albert R. Meyer** <br /> 1,048 pages <br /> Another Discrete Math textbook, this one should take you through both Discrete Math classes. [See the book's page.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/index.htm) |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403739699l/388049.jpg" width="135" /> | **Introduction to Graph Theory by Richard J. Trudeau** <br /> 244 pages <br /> This very short book is a friendly little introduction to Graph Theory, which you'll be touching on in Discrete Mathematics I. You probably won't need to read the whole thing to understand everything needed for the exam, but it's a really great book. | 
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355873412l/13839366.jpg" width="135" /> | **Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser** <br /> 458 pages <br /> In a similar vein to the Graph Theory book I mentioned earlier, you're going to be looking at the Theory of Computation to some extent during the degree program (in this case Discrete Mathematics II), so you won't have to read much of this book to get through the course. You will want to though, because the Theory of Computation is such a core component of computer science. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365104897l/5935435.jpg" width="135" /> | **Introduction to Probability by Dimitri P. Bertsekas, John N. Tsitsiklis** <br /> 528 pages <br /> Probability won't be as large a part of this degree program as some of the other maths, but you will be expected to understand Discrete Probability for Discrete Mathematics II. This book will give you a nice foundation for it. [See the book's page.](http://www.athenasc.com/probbook.html) |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348780612l/112243.jpg" width="135" /> | **Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science by Ronald L. Graham, Donald Ervin Knuth, Oren Patashnik** <br /> 672 pages <br /> You may recognize Knuth for his The Art of Computer Programming series. Concrete Math is a fun math textbook (I know, you can't believe it). [See the book's page.](https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/gkp.html) |

<br />

### Programming Language Essentials
With a strong background in the discrete mathematics and an understanding of how computers work, here's the fun part; programming them to do what you want. Although there are many more languages than what I have listed, I've included books on the languages you're guaranteed to see in this program; Python, C++, Java, and Lua. (For SQL, please see Databases). These books may be of use in the following courses; [C173](C173.md), [C867](C867.md), [C482](C482.md), [C195](C195.md), [C950](C950.md), [C951](C951.md), and [C964](C964.md).

Bhargava** <br /> 256 pages <br /> This is a very beginner friendly book on Algorithms. Although I don't typically consider Algorithms a beginners topic (and the other Algorithms books are later on in the list), I've put this book up top because it's such a great introduction to whet your interests in them. [See the book's page.](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) |


<br />

### Database Essentials
Databases and SQL make up a significant portion of the degree program with three dedicated classes and a project class that requires a decent knowledge of SQL. So I've curated the books in this section to help with studying both databases and the Structured Query Language. These books may be of use in the following courses; [C175](C175.md), [C170](C170.md), [D191](D191.md), and [C195](C195.md)

<br />

|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347462821l/166190.jpg" width="135" /> | **Computer Networks by Andrew S. Tanenbaum** <br /> 912 Pages <br /> This used to be the C172 textbook. That may have changed since but it's not a bad introductory book. |
|<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1458497004l/28636644._SX318_.jpg" width="135" /> | **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by James F. Kurose, Keith Ross** <br /> 864 Pages <br /> Besides the Tanenbaum book, this is the most recommended Networking book I've seen. Even if you aren't interested in working in the field of Networking, it's important stuff to know. |

<br />

### Advanced Computer Science Topics
These books cover some of the more advanced topics that pertain to Computer Science, such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Linear Algebra and other advanced Maths, Distributed Systems, Compilers, Programming Languages (the advanced theory), etc, most of which you won't be seeing in this degree program. Some of them may be helpful for it, but not many. These books may be of use in the following courses; [C951](C951.md) and [C964](C964.md)
